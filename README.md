# Deep Learning Applications on EEG Signal Classification

Final project for Applied Machine Learning.

## Overview
EEG Signal Classification for Movement Detection
A data-driven exploration into the realm of Electroencephalography (EEG) for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project aims to classify EEG signals related to sensorimotor activity, offering insights into movement detection for potential applications in neuro-engineering.

## Key Features
- Machine Learning Models: Leveraging various models including MLP, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and a Stacking Ensemble to achieve accurate EEG signal classification.
- Dimension Reduction with PCA: Employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify meaningful features, enhancing model performance.
- Comprehensive Data Collection: Recorded EEG signals from 16 subjects performing motor imagery and resting state tasks, creating a rich dataset for analysis.

## Results
