# Deep Learning Applications on EEG Signal Classification

Final project for Applied Machine Learning.

## Overview
EEG Signal Classification for Movement Detection.
A data-driven exploration into the realm of Electroencephalography (EEG) for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project aims to classify EEG signals related to sensorimotor activity, offering insights into movement detection for potential applications in neuro-engineering. We played around by implementing different machine learning models, including neural networks learned in class to get to understand more about how things would come out and if the results were as we expected.

## Key Features
- Machine Learning Models: Leveraging various models including MLP, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and a Stacking Ensemble to achieve accurate EEG signal classification.
- Dimension Reduction with PCA: Employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify meaningful features, enhancing model performance.
- Comprehensive Data Collection: Recorded EEG signals from 16 subjects performing motor imagery and resting state tasks, creating a rich dataset for analysis.

## Brief Results
- MLP accuracy score: 0.78
- Logistic Regression accuracy score: 0.76
- SVM accuracy score: 0.78
- Stacking accuracy score: 0.96
